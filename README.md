# Ray Tracer


A fully functioning ray-tracer implemented in C++ that takes .xml scene files as input and produces a .ppm format ray-traced image of the scene.

## How to run

In the "code" folder, in a shell run: `./raytracer <𝑖𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡_𝑓𝑖𝑙𝑒_𝑛𝑎𝑚𝑒>.xml`


## Similar project

I have also implemented a [forward rendering pipeline](https://github.com/AlyAsad/Rasterizer) in C++.
